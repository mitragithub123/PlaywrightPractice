Recording a trace
=====================
Create a Browser Context and Enable Tracing
--------------------------------------------------
BrowserContext browserContext = browser.newContext(new Browser.NewContextOptions().setViewportSize(null));
// Start tracing before creating / navigating a page.
browserContext.tracing()
.start(new Tracing.StartOptions()
.setScreenshots(true)
.setSnapshots(true)
.setSources(true));

Creates a new browser context, simulating an independent browser session.
Enables tracing with:
Screenshots – Captures screenshots during execution.
Snapshots – Captures DOM snapshots for debugging.
Sources – Includes source code references in the trace file.

Stop Tracing and Save the Trace File
--------------------------------------
// Stop tracing and export it into a zip archive.
browserContext.tracing()
.stop(new Tracing.StopOptions()
.setPath(Paths.get("trace.zip"))); // Here we can set trace.zip path

Stops tracing and saves the trace file as trace.zip.
The trace file contains a complete execution history, which can be analyzed later.

Steps to Use Trace Viewer
---------------------------------
1. Open Trace Viewer in Browser
Go to Playwright Trace Viewer.
https://trace.playwright.dev/
Drag and drop the trace.zip file into the viewer.

2. Open Trace File via Command Line (Maven Users)
Navigate to the project folder using the command prompt.
Run the following command:
mvn exec:java -e -D exec.mainClass=com.microsoft.playwright.CLI -D exec.args="show-trace trace.zip"
